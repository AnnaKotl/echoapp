          The goal was to create a two-sided platform simplifying the booking
          process for customers and workload management for cleaners. From the
          customer perspective, the app enables quick service requests with
          transparent pricing and reliable reviews.
        </p>

        <p class="hero-main-text portfolio-text">
          From the cleanerâ€™s side, it offers a steady flow of orders, flexible
          scheduling, and direct communication with clients.
